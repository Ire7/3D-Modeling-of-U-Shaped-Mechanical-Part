# 3D-Modeling-of-U-Shaped-Mechanical-Part


## Objective:
To model a U-shaped mechanical joint that matches the given technical drawing, with precise dimensions and structural features. The design was created in 3D using Tinkercad and includes all essential geometric features for fabrication or simulation (FEA).

Components Created:

## 1. Base Disk (Circular Plate)
  Shape: Cylinder  
  Diameter: 45 mm  
  Height (Thickness): 5 mm  
  Color Used: Orange (Solid)  

## 2. Side Arms (Vertical Supports forming U-shape)
Shape: Boxes (Rectangular Prisms)  
  Each arm dimensions:
  Width: 4.5 mm  
    Depth: ~10 mm (adjusted for spacing)  
    Height: 29 mm  
  Distance between inner faces of arms: 54 mm  
  Quantity: 2  
  Color Used: Red (Solid)  

## 3. Side Holes (for shafts or pins)
Shape: Cylinders (set as Hole)  
Diameter: 5 mm  
Height: 10 mm (to fully pass through the side walls)  
Position: Centered vertically at 14.5 mm from base  
Quantity: 2 (1 on each arm)

## 4. Mounting Holes in Base Disk
Shape: Cylinders (set as Hole)  
Diameter: 5 mm  
Height: 6 mm (enough to pierce through the 5 mm base)  
Quantity: 3  
Position: Arranged in triangular layout (1 front bottom, 2 top sides) matching the technical drawing  

## Tools & Features Used:
Tinkercad Basic Shapes: Cylinder, Box  
Hole Option: Used to subtract geometry for drilling  
Align Tool: For centering the parts perfectly  
Group Tool: To merge all elements into one object  
Snap Grid: Set to 1.0 mm for precise positioning  
Manual Height Adjustment: Using black arrow to set elevation of holes

## Total Features Summary:
Feature                | Count
------------------------|-------
Cylindrical Base       | 1     
Side Arms              | 2     
Side Holes             | 2     
Base Mounting Holes    | 3     
Total Cylindrical Holes| 5     

Final Step:
Exported the model as STL file using Export > .STL  
Ready for:
GitHub Submission
